<h1>Having days off during holidays</h1>

<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>The community I am a part of is called the Bhutanese community, which is a very small community as there are not many Bhutanese people here in nyc. Which means that whenever we have a special holiday we would like to celebrate as a group we can't because most people are working, or they have school. Growing up celebrating holidays with my family was always hard because my parents wouldn't be able to take off during work. I always thought of this to be unfair because during other holidays such as Christmas everyone would be able to have a week off from work, but people in my community wouldn't be able to get off.
</p>

<h1>The Solution</h1>
<p>My friends and I talked to the ambassadors of our community and we came up with an idea of a petition members of our community can sign, and if we get up to a certain amount of signatures then we could possibly make some of our holidays national holidays where people can have off from work.
